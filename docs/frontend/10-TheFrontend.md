# 1.0 The Frontend

This topic covers a couple of basic things about frontend development.

In the first exercise, we'll learn how to add a button to the page that, when clicked, refreshes the todo list.
Along the way, we'll cover concepts like components, state, hooks, and events.

In the second exercise, we'll add a simple checkbox to track the state of each todo item, and turn it into a controlled component with a bit of code.
