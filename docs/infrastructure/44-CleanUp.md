## Removing Everything from the Cloud

### Removing Your Resources

#### Background

One of the reasons we deploy our resources using Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) is because of the ease of representing all resources that are deployed.

If the resource exists in code, it exists in the cloud. Similarly, if the resource ceases to exist within the code, it would cease to exist in the cloud as well (which is exactly what we want at this moment).

#### Instructions


#### Definition of Done

1. All resources in AWS are deleted

---

### Removing Access

#### Background

#### Instructions

1. Sign in to the AWS Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com

### Optional - Deleting AWS Account

If you no longer want to keep your AWS Account for whatever reasons (e.g. fear of unauthorised usage charges appearing on your credit card), you may choose to delete your AWS Account by following the instructions here: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/close-aws-account/
